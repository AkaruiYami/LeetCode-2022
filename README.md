# LeetCode Trials 2022

This is me trying to solve LeetCode Problems in 2022. This is my first time using LeetCode and I hope I can improve my programming skill by trying to solve the problems available in LeetCode.
Currently I'm only write code in python. I hope one day, I'm able to beat my laziness and write code in onther language as well.
